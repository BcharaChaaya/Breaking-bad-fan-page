          Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series
          created and produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. Set and filmed in
          Albuquerque, New Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan
          Cranston), an underpaid, overqualified, and dispirited high-school
          chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis of
          stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and partners
          with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and
          distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future
          before he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal
          underworld. Breaking Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and
          concluded on September 29, 2013, after five seasons consisting of 62
          episodes.

          Among the show's co-stars are Anna Gunn and RJ Mitte as Walter's wife
          Skyler and son Walter Jr., and Betsy Brandt and Dean Norris as
          Skyler's sister Marie Schrader and her husband Hank, a DEA agent.
          Others include Bob Odenkirk as Walter's and Jesse's lawyer Saul
          Goodman, Jonathan Banks as private investigator and fixer Mike
          Ehrmantraut, and Giancarlo Esposito as drug kingpin Gus Fring. The
          final season introduces Jesse Plemons as the criminally ambitious Todd
          Alquist, and Laura Fraser as Lydia Rodarte-Quayle, a cunning business
          executive secretly managing Walter's global meth sales for her
          company.

          Breaking Bad's first season received generally positive reviews, while
          the rest of its run received unanimous critical acclaim, with praise
          for the performances, direction, cinematography, screenplay, story,
          and character development. Since its conclusion, the show has been
          lauded by critics as one of the greatest television series of all
          time. It had fair viewership in its first three seasons, but the
          fourth and fifth seasons saw a moderate rise in viewership when it was
          made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere.
          Viewership increased more drastically upon the premiere of the second
          half of the fifth season in 2013. By the time that the series finale
          aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American
          television. The show received numerous awards, including 16 Primetime
          Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two
          Peabody Awards, two Critics' Choice Awards, and four Television
          Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for
          Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul
          won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a
          Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for
          Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series twice. In 2013,
          Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically
          acclaimed TV show of all time.
        </p>
        The series gave rise to the larger Breaking Bad franchise. Better Call
        Saul, a prequel series featuring Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito reprising
        their Breaking Bad roles, as well as many others in guest and recurring
        appearances, debuted on AMC on February 8, 2015, and concluded on August
        15, 2022. A sequel film, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, starring Paul
        was released on Netflix and in theaters on October 11, 2019.
